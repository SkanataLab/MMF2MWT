MMF2MWT allows command line processing of MMF compressed video files using Rex Kerr's Multi Worm Tracker.

The code for the command line program and the command line program (mmf2mwt.exe) are found in the MWTMMF directory.  mmmf2mwt.exe can be called with several options:

mmf2mwt.exe pathToImageStack\imagestackname.mmf will use default settings and produce output as 

pathToImageStack\TODAYSDATEANDTIME\imagestackname_NNNNNk.blobs
pathToImageStack\TODAYSDATEANDTIME\imagestackname.summary

default settings can be adjusted by editing the file
defaultMWTSettings.txt, which is produced when the program is run for the first time

other options can be found by running mmf2mwt with no arguments


getting the code
------
This code comes as a git module with submodules.  One of the submodules also has a submodule.  

To get all of the code, using the git shell:

git clone git@github.com:samuellab/MMF2MWT.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd Image-Stack-Compressor
git submodule init
git submodule update

This code has a netbeans project (in MWTMMF/nbroject) configured for Windows32 and mingw.  Netbeans and help installing it for your platform are available from netbeans.org

The file mwt2mmf.exe is a compiled windows command line program, which should work on any modern windows system.
